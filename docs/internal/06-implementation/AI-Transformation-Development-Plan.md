## Critical Technical Decisions

### 1. AI Model Strategy
**Decision Required**: Self-hosted vs. API-based LLM

**Option A: API-based (GPT-4o/Claude)**
- ✅ Faster time to market
- ✅ Best-in-class performance
- ✅ Regular model improvements
- ❌ Ongoing API costs ($0.01-0.03 per interaction)
- ❌ Data privacy concerns (user data sent to OpenAI/Anthropic)
- ❌ Latency from API calls

**Option B: Self-hosted (Llama 3, Mistral)**
- ✅ Complete data privacy
- ✅ No per-query costs
- ✅ Customizable fine-tuning
- ❌ Infrastructure costs (GPU servers)
- ❌ Model management complexity
- ❌ Potentially lower quality

**Recommendation**: Start with API-based (GPT-4o) for speed, plan self-hosted migration for privacy-conscious segment.

---

### 2. Frontend Technology
**Decision Required**: Web framework for consumer UI

**Option A: React with Next.js**
- ✅ Largest ecosystem, best developer availability
- ✅ Server-side rendering for performance
- ✅ Strong mobile support via React Native code sharing
- ❌ Larger bundle size

**Option B: Vue.js with Nuxt.js**
- ✅ Simpler learning curve
- ✅ Smaller bundle size
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem
- ❌ Separate mobile codebase

**Recommendation**: React with Next.js for ecosystem maturity and mobile code reuse.

---

### 3. Data Aggregation
**Decision Required**: Bank connection method

**Option A: Plaid**
- ✅ Best-in-class coverage (12,000+ institutions)
- ✅ Reliable, developer-friendly API
- ❌ Expensive ($0.60-1.00 per connection/month)
- ❌ US-focused (limited international)

**Option B: Yodlee**
- ✅ International coverage
- ✅ Lower cost at scale
- ❌ More complex API
- ❌ Older technology stack

**Option C: Manual Import Only (MVP approach)**
- ✅ Zero integration cost
- ✅ Complete user control
- ❌ Poor user experience
- ❌ Limits adoption

**Recommendation**: Start with manual import (MVP), add Plaid in Phase 2, Yodlee for international in Phase 4.

---

### 4. Backend Architecture
**Decision Required**: Monolith vs. microservices

**Option A: Modular Monolith**
- ✅ Simpler deployment and debugging
- ✅ Easier to maintain initially
- ✅ Can evolve to microservices later
- ❌ May face scaling challenges

**Option B: Microservices from Start**
- ✅ Independent scaling
- ✅ Technology flexibility per service
- ❌ Operational complexity
- ❌ Slower initial development

**Recommendation**: Modular monolith with clear module boundaries (current structure is good foundation), migrate to microservices only when scale demands.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: AI Hallucination in Financial Advice**
- **Mitigation**: Rule-based validation layer, human-in-loop for critical decisions, clear disclaimers
- **Fallback**: Offer manual override, provide sources for recommendations

**Risk 2: Data Privacy & Security**
- **Mitigation**: End-to-end encryption, SOC 2 compliance, regular security audits
- **Fallback**: Self-hosted deployment option for enterprise/privacy-conscious users

**Risk 3: Scaling Challenges**
- **Mitigation**: Modular architecture, caching layers, async processing
- **Fallback**: Gradual rollout, waitlist for new users during scaling

**Risk 4: Bank Integration Reliability**
- **Mitigation**: Multi-provider strategy (Plaid + Yodlee), graceful degradation to manual import
- **Fallback**: CSV import always available, batch reconciliation tools

### Product Risks

**Risk 5: User Adoption (Complex Product)**
- **Mitigation**: Guided onboarding, progressive disclosure, demo mode
- **Fallback**: Simplify to core features, user education content

**Risk 6: AI Recommendation Rejection**
- **Mitigation**: Explainable AI, show reasoning, A/B test recommendation styles
- **Fallback**: Let users customize recommendation aggressiveness

**Risk 7: Regulatory Compliance**
- **Mitigation**: Legal consultation, avoid giving "advice" (use "guidance"), clear disclaimers
- **Fallback**: Focus on tools/insights rather than recommendations
