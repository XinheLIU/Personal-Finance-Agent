## Phase 6: Implementation
**Objective:** Build the actual software/agent

### Activities:
- **Development Environment Setup:** Configure tools, repos, environments
- **Sprint Planning:** Break work into manageable sprints (1-2 weeks)
- **Coding Standards:** Establish and follow coding conventions
- **Module Development:** Build modules according to architecture
- **Unit Testing:** Write tests for individual functions
- **Integration:** Connect modules and test interactions
- **Code Reviews:** Peer review all code changes
- **Documentation:** Write inline code comments and technical docs
- **Version Control:** Use Git with proper branching strategy

### Deliverables:
- Working codebase with version control
- Unit test suite with coverage report
- Integration test suite
- Technical documentation
- Code review records
- Build artifacts

---

## Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Objective:** Ensure the software works as intended

### Activities:
- **Functional Testing:** Verify features against acceptance criteria
- **Integration Testing:** Test module interactions
- **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing
- **Security Testing:** Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Have real users test the system
- **Bug Tracking:** Log, prioritize, and fix defects
- **Regression Testing:** Ensure fixes don't break existing features

### Deliverables:
- Test plans and test cases
- Bug reports and resolution log
- Performance benchmarks
- Security audit report
- UAT feedback and sign-off

---

## Phase 8: Deployment & Launch
**Objective:** Release to production

### Activities:
