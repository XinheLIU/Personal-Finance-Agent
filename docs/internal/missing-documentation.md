## Recommendations for Future Documentation

### High Priority (Complete First)
1. **Phase 8: Deployment & Launch** - Critical for production readiness
   - Focus on monitoring setup and rollback procedures
   - Document environment configuration

2. **Phase 9: Post-Launch & Iteration** - Essential for maintenance
   - Start with bug tracking and user feedback systems
   - Establish analytics review processes

3. **Phase 3: Design** - Improves development consistency
   - Create basic design system documentation
   - Document UI/UX patterns for consistency

### Medium Priority (Complete As Needed)
4. **Phase 6: Implementation** - Supplement existing documentation
   - Add sprint logs when implementing new features
   - Document code review processes

### Documentation Templates to Create
- Sprint planning template
- Code review checklist template
- Deployment checklist template
- Bug report template
- Feature request template
- Performance monitoring report template
- User feedback survey template

---

## Notes

- The project currently has excellent documentation for Phases 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7
- The accounting module has particularly strong workflow documentation
- Future features should include corresponding documentation in all 9 phases
- Consider using the development-workflow.md as a checklist for new features

---

## Action Items

- [ ] Create Phase 3 design documentation for existing accounting modules
- [ ] Document current deployment procedures in Phase 8
- [ ] Establish post-launch monitoring in Phase 9
- [ ] Create documentation templates for recurring processes
- [ ] Review and update this gap analysis quarterly
