# Performance Attribution Analysis Guide

This guide explains the professional performance attribution system implemented in the Personal Finance Agent, designed for both users and developers to understand the attribution methodology and implementation.

## üìä Overview

Performance attribution analysis is a fundamental tool in institutional investment management that decomposes portfolio returns to understand the sources of performance. Our system implements industry-standard methodologies used by professional asset managers to answer the critical question: **"Where did my returns come from?"**

## üéØ What is Performance Attribution?

Performance attribution breaks down portfolio returns into specific components to understand:

1. **Which assets or sectors contributed most to returns**
2. **The impact of allocation decisions** (how much to invest in each sector)
3. **The impact of selection decisions** (which specific assets to choose within sectors)
4. **The effect of rebalancing activities** over time

This analysis is essential for:
- **Portfolio Managers**: Understanding strategy effectiveness
- **Risk Managers**: Identifying concentration risks
- **Investors**: Making informed allocation decisions
- **Compliance**: Meeting institutional reporting requirements

## üèóÔ∏è Attribution Methodologies

### Asset-Level Attribution

Asset-level attribution decomposes portfolio returns at the individual asset level:

```
Portfolio Return = Œ£(Asset Weight √ó Asset Return) + Rebalancing Effects + Interaction Effects
```

**Components:**
- **Asset Contributions**: `Asset Weight[t-1] √ó Asset Return[t]`
- **Rebalancing Impact**: `(Asset Weight[t] - Asset Weight[t-1]) √ó Asset Return[t]`
- **Total Attribution**: Sum of all asset contributions plus rebalancing effects

**Use Cases:**
- Identify top/bottom performing assets
- Understand impact of individual holdings
- Analyze rebalancing effectiveness

### Sector-Based Attribution (Brinson Model)

The Brinson attribution model is the industry standard for sector-based performance attribution, comparing portfolio performance to a benchmark:

#### Core Brinson Formulas

**1. Allocation Effect**
```
Allocation Effect = (Portfolio Weight - Benchmark Weight) √ó Benchmark Return
AE = (wp - wb) √ó rb
```
*Measures the impact of over/under-weighting sectors relative to benchmark*

**2. Selection Effect**
```
Selection Effect = Benchmark Weight √ó (Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return)
SE = wb √ó (rp - rb)
```
*Measures the impact of asset selection within sectors*

**3. Interaction Effect**
```
Interaction Effect = (Portfolio Weight - Benchmark Weight) √ó (Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return)
IE = (wp - wb) √ó (rp - rb)
```
*Captures the combined impact of allocation and selection decisions*

**Total Excess Return**
```
Total Excess Return = Allocation Effect + Selection Effect + Interaction Effect
```

## üèõÔ∏è Institutional Sector Classification

Our system uses 9 professional sectors based on GICS-like standards:

| Sector | Description | Example Assets |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Technology** | Tech hardware, software, semiconductors | NASDAQ100, HSTECH |
| **US_Equity** | US large-cap equity indices | SP500 |
| **China_Equity** | Chinese A-shares and HK equities | CSI300, CSI500, HSI |
| **Government_Bonds** | Treasury bonds and TIPS | TLT, IEF, SHY, TIP |
| **International_Equity** | Developed and emerging markets | VEA, VWO |
| **Commodities** | Precious metals and commodities | GLD, DBC |
| **Real_Estate** | Real Estate Investment Trusts | VNQ |
| **Cash_Equivalents** | Money market and short-term treasury | CASH |
| **Finance** | Banks, insurance, financial services | *(Custom mapping)* |

### Benchmark Weights

Default balanced portfolio benchmark weights:
- **US_Equity**: 35%
- **Technology**: 15%
- **International_Equity**: 15%
- **Government_Bonds**: 20%
- **China_Equity**: 10%
- **Cash_Equivalents**: 2%
- **Commodities**: 2%

## üßÆ Mathematical Examples

### Example: Sector Attribution Calculation

**Scenario**: Technology sector analysis
- Portfolio Weight (wp): 20%
- Benchmark Weight (wb): 15%  
- Portfolio Return (rp): 8%
- Benchmark Return (rb): 5%

**Calculations**:
```
Allocation Effect = (0.20 - 0.15) √ó 0.05 = 0.05 √ó 0.05 = 0.25%
Selection Effect = 0.15 √ó (0.08 - 0.05) = 0.15 √ó 0.03 = 0.45%
Interaction Effect = (0.20 - 0.15) √ó (0.08 - 0.05) = 0.05 √ó 0.03 = 0.15%
Total Effect = 0.25% + 0.45% + 0.15% = 0.85%
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Allocation Effect (0.25%)**: Benefit from overweighting Technology vs benchmark
- **Selection Effect (0.45%)**: Benefit from Technology outperforming benchmark
- **Interaction Effect (0.15%)**: Additional benefit from both overweighting AND outperformance
- **Total Effect (0.85%)**: Technology sector contributed 0.85% to excess return

## üîç Interpretation Guide

### Positive vs Negative Effects

#### Allocation Effect
- **Positive**: Overweighted outperforming sectors or underweighted underperforming sectors
- **Negative**: Overweighted underperforming sectors or underweighted outperforming sectors

#### Selection Effect  
- **Positive**: Selected assets outperformed their sector benchmark
- **Negative**: Selected assets underperformed their sector benchmark

#### Interaction Effect
- **Positive**: Overweighted sectors that you also selected well (or underweighted sectors you selected poorly)
- **Negative**: Overweighted sectors that you selected poorly (or underweighted sectors you selected well)

### Strategic Insights

**Strong Allocation Effects** suggest:
- Effective sector timing decisions
- Good macro-economic analysis
- Successful sector rotation strategies

**Strong Selection Effects** suggest:
- Effective security selection within sectors
- Good fundamental analysis
- Successful stock-picking abilities

**High Interaction Effects** suggest:
- Coordinated allocation and selection decisions
- Concentrated bets that paid off (or didn't)

## üîß Developer Guide

### Adding New Sectors

To add new sectors to the classification:

```python
# In config/sectors.py
SECTORS['New_Sector'] = {
    'description': 'New sector description',
    'color': '#hexcolor'
}

ASSET_SECTOR_MAPPING['NEW_ASSET'] = 'New_Sector'
```

### Custom Attribution Models

To implement custom attribution models:

```python
class CustomAttributor(SectorAttributor):
    def calculate_custom_attribution(self, ...):
        # Implement custom attribution logic
        # Return List[SectorAttributionResult]
        pass
```

### Performance Optimization

For large datasets:
- Use vectorized operations with pandas/numpy
- Implement data chunking for memory efficiency
- Cache intermediate calculations
- Use multiprocessing for parallel sector calculations
